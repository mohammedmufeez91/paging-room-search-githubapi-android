         * The alternative to List<Repo> is a PagedList<Repo>. A PagedList is a version of a List
         * that loads content in chunks. Similar to the List, the PagedList holds a snapshot of content,
         * so updates occur when new instances of PagedList are delivered via LiveData.
         * When a PagedList is created, it immediately loads the first chunk of data and expands
         * over time as content is loaded in future passes. The size of PagedList is the number of
         * items loaded during each pass. The class supports both infinite lists and very large
         * lists with a fixed number of elements.
         *
         * The PagedList loads content dynamically from a source. In our case, because the database
         * is the main source of truth for the UI, it also represents the source for the PagedList.
         * If your app gets data directly from the network and displays it without caching,
         * then the class that makes network requests would be your data source.
