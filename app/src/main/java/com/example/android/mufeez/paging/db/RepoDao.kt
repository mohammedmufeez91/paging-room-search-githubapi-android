    /* DataSource.Factory
    A source is defined by a DataSource class. To page in data from a source that can change—such
    as a source that allows inserting, deleting or updating data—you will also need to implement
    a DataSource.Factory that knows how to create the DataSource. Whenever the data is updated,
    the DataSource is invalidated and re-created automatically through the DataSource.Factory.
    The Room persistence library provides native support for data sources associated with the
    Paging library. For a given query, Room allows you to return a DataSource.Factory
    from the DAO and handles the implementation of the DataSource for you.
